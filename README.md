# Python solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems

This also serves as an example of how to set up a Python package.

I used this [helpful Python packaging tutorial](http://www.scotttorborg.com/python-packaging/) as a guide.

## To run tests

```
$ python setup.py nosetests
```

## To install the package `project_euler`

```
$ python setup.py install
```

## To run an answer

```
$ bin/answer1
```
